For router, i see that merging the 'running' file is okay.

NOTE: these step below can apply to anything :3
But for the asa. You have to do these steps:
- delete the NVRAM from device -> config -> global settings (this will delete the start up file)
- In the 'start-up config' field, choose 'load' and load with the 'running' file (not the startup one)
- go to console, use command 'reload'
- voila you have perfectly synced shit.
